# raw-printf
This is my implementation of the function printf just as it was submitted for the subject, any changes, upgrades or adaptations -if made- will be on [my libft](https://github.com/luna7111/libft) repository. The project graded 100%.

> [!WARNING]
>
> This repository is archived bc its only purpose is to show colleagues how i solved this project. It is not mantained and CLEARLY not an optimal implementation of the printf function.
